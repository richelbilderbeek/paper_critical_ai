## The dialogue

### D1. Ask an AI to read the dataset

The dialogue starts by uploading the data for the paper
at [here](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/Bolnick_and_Stutz_2017/blob/master/Bolnick_traits.txt).

### D2. Describe the dataset

- The `fishID` column denotes the ID of a fish. How many fish are in this dataset?

The correct answer is 300.

- The `origin` column denotes the location where each fish comes from.
  Which location do the fish come from?

The correct answers is 'Lake' and 'Stream'

- The `transplant` column denotes the location where each fish is transplanted
  to.
  Which locations where the fish transplanted to?

The correct answers is 'Lake' and 'Stream' and 'Control'

- Remove the rows for which the `transplant` value is 'Control'. How
  many fish are left?

The correct answer is (300 / 2 =) 150.

- The `pre_mass` column denotes the mass of a fish before the transplantation.
  What is the range of the values in this column?

The correct answer is 0.5 to 3.6.

- The `survived` column denotes if the fish survived the experiment,
  where 0 means it died and 1 means that it survived.
  How many fish died? And how many survived?

The correct answers are ... and ...

- The `enclosure` column denotes the ID of an enclosure.
  How many enclosures are in this dataset?

The correct answer is (150 /3 = ) 50 enclosures

- How many fish are in each enclosure?

The correct answer is 3.

### **Q0**. Describe the conclusion

- A conclusing drawn from the data
  is that the extreme body masses
  are likelier to survive. Would you agree that the data supports
  this claim?

### D4. Reproduce the results in that paper

- ...

### **Q1**: Ask if the conclusion is correct

- A conclusing drawn from the data
  is that the extreme body masses
  are likelier to survive. Would you agree that the data supports
  this claim?


### D5 Reproduce the results that show a flaw in the reasoning

- ...

### **Q2**: Ask if the conclusion is correct

- A conclusing drawn from the data
  is that the extreme body masses
  are likelier to survive. Would you agree that the data supports
  this claim?

## Pilot study

A pilot study was conducted to reproduce the figure of the original paper.
The AI failed, but made reasonable attempts.

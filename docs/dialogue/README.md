# The dialogue

The dialogue can be found here:

- [dialogue.Rmd](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/paper_critical_ai/blob/main/docs/dialogue/dialogue.Rmd): the R markdown document
- [dialogue.pdf](dialogue.pdf): a PDF of the rendered R markdown document

It is based on the data in [Bolnick_traits.txt](Bolnick_traits.txt).

???- question "How is the PDF created?"

    By running, in this repository's root folder, the command:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/create_pdf_of_rmd_dialogue.R
    ```

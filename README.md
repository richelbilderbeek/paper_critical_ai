# Can AI be used for academic critical thinking? A pregistered example

- Authors: RJCB, JMS

## Abstract

AI does stuff.
Can it do the critical thinking as required by academia?
Here we test this on a known flawed paper,
where we steer it to reproduce the same plots
and draw its own conclusion, as well as confront
it with the conclusion of the paper.
We find that ..., meaning that AI ...

## Introduction

AI does stuff [reference].

AI can do critical thinking to some extent [reference].

## Hypothesis

- H0: AI cannot be used for critical thinking
- H1: AI can be used for critical thinking

## Methods

- Take a dataset and the code of a published paper with a known flaw
- Ask an AI to read the dataset
- Describe to the AI the dataset
- Describe to the AI the hypothesis being tested
- Describe to the AI the conclusion
- Talk the AI to reproduce the results in that paper
- Q1: Ask the AI if the conclusion is correct
- Talk the AI to reproduce the results that show a flaw in the reasoning
- Q2: Ask the AI if the conclusion is correct

The conclusion is drawn according to this

Q1 |Q2 |Verdict
---|---|---------------------------------------
Yes|Yes|AI is not critical
Yes|No |AI is critical
